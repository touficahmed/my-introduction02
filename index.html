            I left Dhaka Gazipur for a chilla (tabligh) as soon as I gave my SSC exam Alhamdulillah, dawat work
            continues well there.On 28 December 2021, the day when our SSC result will be given, my condition is very
            bad and I am sweating from head to toe. The Head of Tabligh and also the companions were telling me that
            something good would happen inshallah. don't stress Call Allah more and more. I prayed So when I heard the
            result (Alhamdulillah) I got <mark class="mark1">GPA 5.00.</mark>I was overwhelmed
            when I heard my result and my family was overjoyed with the result.But I couldn't think of what to do in the
            future, what category I should study. Some say to get admission in textile, some say to get diploma, some
            say to study, I could not understand anything, I mean, my eyes and face are dark. I thought a lot later.An
            infinite mercy of Allah Ta'ala was revealed to me that such unseen understanding created a feeling in the
            mind. That you get admission in Madrasah, you study in Madrasah, you become a scholar. Still, I thought a
            lot, a long time passed, one week, two weeks passed, I filled the form for admission in various colleges and
            registered. Our most reputed college in Natore is NS College. There I got a chance in the science group. But
            I don't know why my mind was not drawn in that direction.Later father and mother gave me permission But they
            did not agree on this at first. But after one or two days they said go do what you like we gave you
            permission. Then God's power did not search in any Madrasa. I had a hafez friend. I contacted him where he
            studied in the country. So I went to this madrasa without thinking about it anymore, I contacted Huzur and
            then I got admission in Madrasa.Then an interesting thing is that <span class="span1"><i>my Madrasa studies are going on for 3-3.5 years.</i></span> And another surprising thing is that I could pass the exams in the madrasa
            among the first three. Which could not have been possible without the infinite mercy of Allah.

            Why did I come to the world of freelancing ?

        </h1>

        <p>
            Originally I was a resident student in the madrasa. But my father is sick and my brother is a web developer,
            by God's grace he is now running the family expenses. Alhamdulillah he earns well. But he is struggling to
            run the family due to the rise of the commodity. We are 5 family members. The cost is high. So I am now
            non-resident. I go to and from the madrasa. For this I chose Freelance as a career. In addition to studies,
            money can be earned in a halal way... <mark class="mark2">INSHA ALLAH.</mark>

            Why i chose Shopify ?
        </h1>

        <p>
            My brother gave me two niches first. SHOPIFY and WIX. Then I started to talk a little about these two
            niches. Most of the YouTube channel videos I saw are saying that Shopify is the Big Future. In one word,
            Gold Rush can be said. Later my brother said that you do course in Shopify category. That's why I choose
            Shopify.At first I followed CODEMANEDB YOUTUBE CHANNEL. I Checked out their full "SHOPIFY PLAYLIST". But the
            full education is not available through the free videos that are available on YouTube. Through
            online/offline live to live learning, all the mistakes, all the problems can be removed by discussing with
            the mentor/ teacher. But that cannot be removed by watching videos offline. Masters have different needs of
            mentors. Who will make a "BEGINNER ZERO TO HERO". And SHOPIFY seems very easy to me.And "FARID RONY"
            brother, to be honest, it will not be wrong to say ONE OF THE BEST MENTOR IN BANGLADESH for SHOPIFY. I don't
            know how anyone feels. But I personally like him for his skills, for his speech. SO, that's why I chose the
            <span class="span2"><em>"Shikhbe Sobai platform."</em></span>
            I repeat again that I did not say this for Rhea. I am not showing anyone.I did not ask to show people. I
            just shared a life story with you. Stay well, keep praying.
